## üëã Hi there!

I'm a physics student who enjoys diving into new software and discovering the endless possibilities it unlocks. Whether it's writing code, designing models, or experimenting with simulations, I love figuring out how things work and building my own spin on them.

Currently exploring the intersection of code, physics, and design through self-driven projects. You'll mostly find personal experiments here like my current take on a weather app, which is still a work in progress.
